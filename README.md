## Arcane Breezehome

<https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=7780>

Adds an Arcane Enchanter to Breezehome in Whiterun.

Please note: This is my first mod. The placement isn't very immersive, however it was important to me not to alter any other objects (barrels, etc.) in the house. The enchanter will be present after the initial purchase of the house, no upgrades required.

Hint: There's a vanilla-storage container (sack) right behind the table, under the shelf.

## Arcane Breezehome 2

<https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=13518>

Adds an Arcane Enchanter to the Alchemy Laboratory in Breezehome, Whiterun.

Please note: This mod also modifies the location of three books and a jug, plus removes a chair. If you're looking for a mod that only adds a table but doesn't alter anything else, checkout the original Breezehome mod: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=7780

## Dim Torches

<https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=8083>

Carefully reduced the brightness of torches for less bright/reflecting dungeon walls. Latest update increases the light-radius by 50%.

There are no other changes, sadly similar torch-mods also tinker with the duration.

## Prolonged Enchanting Potions (purchasable)

<https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=11424>

Prolonged Enchanting Potions from 60 seconds to 10 minutes. Now you got enough time to properly name items when you need to craft a whole set.

This mod only changes *purchasable* potions. See here for it's sister-mod that alters home-brewed potions: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=12000


## Prolonged Enchanting Potions (home-brewed)

<https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=12000>

Prolonged Enchanting player-crafted Potions from 60 seconds to 10 minutes. Now you got enough time to properly name items when you need to craft a whole set.

This mod only changes *home-brewed* potions. See here for it's sister-mod that alters purchasable potions: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=11424


## Renamed Dragon Claws

<https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=14648>

Renames Dragon Claws in order to group them together in your inventory

"Ruby Dragon Claw" -> "Dragon Claw (Ruby)"
"Golden Dragon Claw" -> "Dragon Claw (Golden)"
and so on...

## Uncertain Impact

<https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=15324>

Changes the stagger probability of the Impact perk from 100% to 75%

75% is still a high percentage (in comparison, the chance to stagger an enemy with a bow is 50%) however the uncertainty forces you to use dual-casting destruction spells against single enemies with more care.
